# catch_diamond_game
This is my first project in university. Just a simple game.

This is a game of going towards the diamond crossing the hiding bombs in your way.

Simple game. You will start from a position and you need to go towards the diamond.
But the way isn't going to be easy. In your way there are many bombs but all are invisible.
When you close to a bomb it will show it's face. And immediately you need to change your way.
And yes, you need to focus on the clock. Because time limit is 60 sec.
When you reach a congratulation note will come and you can cancel or restart the game from there.
But when you touch the bomb the game is over and you can play again.
Every time the game starts again time will reset to 0.

Thanks.
